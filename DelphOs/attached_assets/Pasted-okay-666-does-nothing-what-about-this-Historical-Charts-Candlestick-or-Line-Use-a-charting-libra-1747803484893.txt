Historical Charts (Candlestick or Line)
Use a charting library (like Chart.js, ApexCharts, or TradingView Widgets) to plot price data and RSI. but you have to click into the coin to access the chart
Allow toggling timeframe (1D, 7D, 1M, etc).

ML Explanation Tooltip
Add an info tooltip or expandable section showing:
RSI

Volatility

Confidence score breakdown

Training data size

Mobile Responsiveness
Ensure your dashboard UI looks good on phones and tablets using media queries or Tailwind CSS breakpoints.

I'd like to upgrade the machine learning model in my generate_prediction(data) function to include more technical indicators and custom features. This is for a cryptocurrency prediction app built with Flask and yfinance.

‚úÖ Keep the current RSI-based approach, but add these additional ML features to the model pipeline:

Technical Indicators (use ta or pandas-ta):

MACD and MACD Signal Line
EMA (12-day and 26-day)
Bollinger Bands (20 period)
Stochastic Oscillator (K & D)
ADX (Average Directional Index)
On-Balance Volume (OBV)
Commodity Channel Index (CCI)
Custom Engineered Features:

Rolling mean and std deviation for Close price (5d, 10d)
Daily high-low spread
Volume spike ratio (volume / rolling mean volume)
RSI divergence (if RSI trend contradicts price trend)
Target:

Keep classification target (next day price direction: 1 or 0)
Also add a regression target (next-day return) if possible, for future enhancement
Scaling:

Apply StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler to all features before training
Fallback:

If there‚Äôs not enough data (under 30 rows), fallback to the current rule_based_prediction() logic
Finally, refactor the model code to train with these new features, and return prediction, confidence, and reason just like before.

Optional: Wrap the indicator generation into a function like generate_features(df) for clarity and reusability.
